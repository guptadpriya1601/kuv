## No Code Contributions

If you are a non-developer or do not want to contribute as a developer, you can do that by filling any of the form on the [contribute page](https://techroadmap.xyz/contribute) on our website.

## The Goal

- The goal is not to have the largest list of resources but to have a relevant list of resources that are most relevant to the career path today.
- These lists are highly opinionated and curated. so understand that your opinion might not match the opinion of the curator.

## Contributions Allowed

- Fixing grammar mistakes or typos on the contents of the website,
- Contributing to the content and resources of the website,
- Editing, or suggesting changes to the existing roadmaps,
- Adding a new roadmap,
- Contributing to the UI design of the site,
- Refactoring our codebase, etc.

## Making Commits

- Commit messages should be meaningful.
- Commit messages should be as descriptive as possible.
- All changes made should be committed.
- Ensure all important changes are committed seperately (i.e. one relevant change per commit).

## Opening Issues and Pull Requests

- Before creating an Issue or Pull Request, ensure that there are no existing ones.
- Give only one item per Issue or Pull Request.
- The title of an Issue and Pull Request should be as descriptive as possible.
- Always include the Issue number the Pull Request closes, i.e `This Pull Request closes Issue #5.`
- Attach images, links, and other relevant information where necessary when creating an Issue or Pull Request.

## Contributing Codes

- Do not make changes to existing code without first discussing it with the curator.
- Do not add new codes without first discussing it with the curator.
- Follow the templates available or look at existing codes when adding new resources.

## Adding Links or Resources

- Before adding a new Link or Resource, ensure that there are no existing ones.
- Add only Links or Resources relevant to a particular career path.
- All Links or Resources should be arranged sequentially. For example, in the Frontend Roadmap, the CSS section can not come before the Html section because one has to learn Html first before moving on to CSS, then Javascript. This is because beginners learning a new career do not have any knowledge on the skills to acquire first nor the skill to learn next. Our goal is to ease their learning journey not confuse or stress them.
- Always give a descriptive name to any Link added and include the Author/Creator/Site the link was gotten from. An example is [21 nocode jobs in the tech industry ~ Timonwa](https://blog.timonwa.com/you-dont-need-to-write-code-to-become-a-tech-sisbro) or [How to create your own custom code snippets right in your code editor ~ FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-your-own-custom-code-snippets/). Do not capitalize each word in the link description.
- If the Link or Resource requires a badge, please add one. Badges can be `Free`, `Paid`, `Article`, `Video`, etc. You can check the present links or template to confirm if a badge is needed.
- Always confirm that every Link or Resource you add directs you to the right page, i.e. the link should not be broken or give an error status of `404 page Not Found`.
- Do not add any Link or Resource you are no sure of or evaluated/used personally.

## Adding Roadmaps

- Before suggesting or adding any Roadmap, ensure that there are no existing ones.
- Discuss any changes, updates or additions to the resources of pre-existing Roadmaps with the curator first before creating an Issue or Pull Request. You can do that in Tech Roadmap [Discussions Page](https://github.com/Timonwa/techroadmap/discussions/categories/ideas) or send an email to [techcareerroadmap@gmail.com](mailto:techcareerroadmap@gmail.com).
- Discuss the addition of a Roadmap with the curator first before creating an Issue or Pull Request. You can do that in Tech Roadmap [Discussions Page](https://github.com/Timonwa/techroadmap/discussions/categories/ideas) or send an email to [techcareerroadmap@gmail.com](mailto:techcareerroadmap@gmail.com).

Thank you and Welcome!
